Welcome.

I created this website to publish more about myself because I feel like I’ve just entered a new era in my life. Until this year (2026), I believed that writing code would be my job until retirement, but I don’t think that’s likely to be true anymore. Everything changed after LLMs, especially with the latest models like ChatGPT 5.2 or Claude Opus, because they can write code better than many of us.

Since writing code is no longer a bottleneck, I want to focus on improving other software engineering skills. I also like being part of product development, and I believe this will be an important skill in the coming years. Here is a great article about [product-minded engineer](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-product-minded-engineer) by Gergely Orosz.

I don’t know exactly what I should do in 2026 yet, but I’m starting by creating this website.

More soon.
