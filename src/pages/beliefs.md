A running list of things I believe.

## Product & craft
- Shipping small things consistently beats planning big things perfectly.
- The best products feel obvious in hindsight.
- Great UX is often just removing friction.

## Engineering
- Developer experience is a product.
- Tooling pays compounding interest.
- Defaults matter more than docs.

## AI
- LLMs are leverage — but only if you build reliable workflows around them.
- The best use cases start narrow and become general over time.

## Life
- Consistency beats intensity.
- Protect your attention.
